- **Buyer Interface:** Provides buyers with an interface to purchase products and generate receipts.
- **Data Persistence:** Utilizes a text file as a database to store information about products, prices, and discounts.
- **Efficient Workflow:** Streamlines supermarket operations by automating billing processes.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the C++ code using a compatible compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable to launch the supermarket billing system.
4. Choose between the administrator and buyer options to perform respective tasks.
